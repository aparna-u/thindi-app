```

### Step 3: Pick an Issue

Make sure that the issue:
- Has a **clear and well-defined scope**.
- Does not overlap with someone else's ongoing work.

### Step 4: Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your contribution:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Ensure your branch name reflects the purpose of the work (e.g., `fix-bug-in-payment`, `add-new-feature-x`).

### Step 5: Make Changes

1. Make your code changes.
2. Write clear and meaningful commit messages. For example:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix: Correct payment gateway bug in order submission"
   ```

### Step 6: Test Changes Locally

Please ensure that all your changes are tested locally. Run the frontend and backend, and make sure everything works as expected:

### Step 7: Push Changes to Your Fork

Once you‚Äôre satisfied with your changes, push them to your fork:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### Step 8: Create a Pull Request

Go to the [original repository](https://github.com/arshadpatel/thindi-app) and create a pull request from your fork. Your PR should:
- Describe the changes you made.
- Reference the issue you are resolving (if applicable).
- Include relevant screenshots or explanations if needed.

The project maintainers will review your PR and provide feedback if necessary. Be sure to respond to feedback promptly.

## ü§ñ Contribution Guidelines

- **Follow the Project Structure**: Make sure your code follows the existing structure of the project and adheres to the defined conventions.
- **Write Clear Commit Messages**: Provide meaningful and descriptive commit messages.
- **Avoid Unnecessary Changes**: Avoid unrelated changes such as formatting fixes that are not part of your contribution.
- **Stay Organized**: When contributing, try to keep changes organized and focused on a single objective (fix a bug, add a feature, etc.).

## üìù Code Style

To maintain consistency across the codebase, please adhere to the following guidelines:
- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- **Variable Naming**: Use meaningful variable names in camelCase.
- **Comments**: Use comments when necessary to explain complex logic.
- **React Component Naming**: Use PascalCase for component names and filenames.

## üõ† Development Setup

### Backend
The backend is built using **Node.js** with **Express.js** and **MongoDB**. If you‚Äôre working on backend functionality, make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed locally, or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud instance.

### Frontend
The frontend uses **React.js**. If you‚Äôre contributing to the frontend, make sure you have a basic understanding of React components, routing, and state management.

### Database
If you're working on database-related tasks, familiarize yourself with **MongoDB**. We use **Mongoose** for database modeling.

### Payment Integration
We use **Razorpay** for UPI payments. If your contribution involves payment integration, make sure to test it with sandbox API keys.
