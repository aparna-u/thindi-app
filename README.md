# Thindi App

Welcome to the Thindi App project! This web application aims to streamline the ordering process in a college canteen where multiple vendors operate. The app allows students to scan a QR code corresponding to a vendor, view the daily menu, place orders, and pay using UPI (Google Pay, Paytm, PhonePe, etc.). Vendors can see orders in real-time, update the order status, and view daily sales analytics.
